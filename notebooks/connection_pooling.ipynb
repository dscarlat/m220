    "When issuing several different requests to the database, we could take the lazy approach and just create a new connection whenever we need to make a request, and when the request's done we just destroy the connection. The issue with this approach is that establishing a database connection requires time and computing resources, to complete the handshake with the server and whatnot. We're essentially paying the cost of waiting for this connection to establish for every request.\n",

    "Connection pooling helps reduce the overhead of creating database connections, by creating a whole bunch right off the bat. Then as requests come in, different connections in the pool are allocated to fulfill those requests.\n",

    "By default, drivers will establish a connection pool with 100 connections to share. So 100 connections will get created off the bat, and then get assigned to different requests as they come in. This default of 100 connections is adequate for most applications.\n",

    "Additionally, if we didn't use a connection pool and we suddently got a **whole lot** of requests, we might easily reach the limit that our hardware and software could handle, leading to a lot of errors and unhappy developers."
