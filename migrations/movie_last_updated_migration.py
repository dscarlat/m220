Ticket: Migration

Update all the documents in the `movies` collection, such that the "lastupdated"
field is stored as an ISODate() rather than a string.

The parser.parse() method can transform date strings into ISODate objects for
us. We just need to make sure the correct operations are sent to MongoDB!
